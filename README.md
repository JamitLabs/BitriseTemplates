# BitriseTemplates

A set of thoughtful YAML templates to kickoff [Bitrise CI](https://www.bitrise.io) configuration.

## Usage

Read [this article](https://medium.com/@Dschee/ff039c4214b1) for a full understanding on how to get started using Bitrise CI and to learn some of the best practices applied within these configuration templates. This repository consists of separate folders containing configurations for `Community` projects which apply to a wider variety of project setups, whereas projects based on the [best practices](https://github.com/JamitLabs/NewProjectTemplate-iOS) within our company are placed within the `JamitLabs` folder.

Note that each configuration file contains an environment variables section at the end with multiple `TODO` values which need to be updated to the projects correct values to complete the setup.
